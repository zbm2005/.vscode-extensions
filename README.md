# .vscode-extensions

A curated list of Visual Studio Code extensions that I use in my development setup.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains the VS Code extensions I rely on daily (or periodically) — covering productivity, themes, code quality, and more.

By tracking them here:

- I can easily reinstall them when I move to a new machine.
- Others can see which extensions I prefer and maybe pick some.
- I keep a version-controlled list that evolves with my workflow.

## 📦 What's Inside

- `extensions/` — A file (or JSON) listing the extensions (e.g., from `code --list-extensions`).
- `argv.json` — (If present) Custom VS Code arguments/configuration I use.
